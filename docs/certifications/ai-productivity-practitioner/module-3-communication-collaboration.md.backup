## Tips & Common Mistakes

### 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Create Template Library**: Build reusable prompts for recurring meetings/presentations
2. **Combine AI Outputs**: Generate multiple versions and combine the best elements
3. **Personalize AI Content**: Always add your own examples, anecdotes, and personality
4. **Use AI for Preparation**: Get the most value in planning phases, not just execution
5. **Save Good Prompts**: Document what works for different communication scenarios
6. **Iterate on Presentations**: Generate outlines first, then drill into details
7. **Cultural Sensitivity**: When working globally, ask AI to check for cultural considerations

### ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

1. **Over-Relying on AI in Real-Time**: Don't let AI distract you during actual conversations
2. **Generic Communication**: AI-generated messages without personalization feel cold
3. **Skipping Human Review**: Always review AI content before sharing with stakeholders
4. **Ignoring Nuance**: Complex conflicts need human empathy, not just AI frameworks
5. **Template Fatigue**: Vary your communication style; don't use same structure every time
6. **Missing Context**: AI doesn't know your organization's history or politics—add that context
7. **Forgetting Relationships**: Communication is about connection, not just information transfer
