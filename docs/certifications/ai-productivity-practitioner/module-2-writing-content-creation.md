## Lesson 2.1: Advanced Prompting for Content Creation

### The Content Creation Framework

To generate high-quality content consistently, use the **CRAFT framework**:

**C - Context**: What's the background?  
**R - Role**: What perspective should the AI take?  
**A - Audience**: Who is this for?  
**F - Format**: How should it be structured?  
**T - Tone**: What's the voice and style?  

### Advanced Prompting Techniques

#### Technique 1: Multi-Step Instructions

Break complex tasks into clear steps within a single prompt.

**Example:**
```
Write a LinkedIn post about AI productivity tools. Follow these steps:

1. Start with an attention-grabbing question or statistic
2. Share 3 specific tools with brief descriptions (max 30 words each)
3. Include a personal insight or lesson learned
4. End with a call-to-action asking readers to share their favorite tools
5. Use 2-3 relevant hashtags

Length: 150-200 words
Tone: Professional but conversational
Audience: Mid-level professionals in tech and business
```

#### Technique 2: Voice Cloning with Examples

Teach the AI your writing style by providing examples.

**Example:**
```
I want you to write in my style. Here are 3 examples of my writing:

[Example 1: Your previous email/post]
[Example 2: Another sample]
[Example 3: Third sample]

Now write a similar piece about [topic], maintaining the same tone, sentence structure, and vocabulary level.
```

#### Technique 3: Iterative Refinement

Guide the AI through multiple versions.

**Example:**
```
Write a product description for [product].

Requirements:
- 100 words maximum
- Focus on benefits, not features
- Use power words (e.g., "transform", "effortless", "proven")
- Include social proof or a statistic
- End with urgency (limited time, exclusive offer)

After you write it, I'll ask you to:
1. Make it more concise
2. Adjust the tone
3. Add specific details
```

#### Technique 4: Constraint-Based Prompting

Use creative constraints to generate unique content.

**Example:**
```
Write an email introducing our new software update. Constraints:

Must include:
- A metaphor or analogy in the first paragraph
- Exactly 3 new features, each explained in one sentence
- A benefit statement for each feature
- No buzzwords or jargon

Must NOT include:
- More than 150 words
- Exclamation marks
- Generic phrases like "we're excited to announce"

Tone: Friendly and confident
```

#### Technique 5: Role-Play Scenarios

Have AI adopt specific expert personas.

**Example:**
```
You are a senior copywriter at a top advertising agency with 15 years of experience in tech marketing. Your specialty is writing compelling ad copy that converts.

Write 5 different Google ad headlines (max 30 characters each) for a project management tool targeting startup founders.

For each headline, explain:
- Why it would resonate with the target audience
- What psychological principle it uses (urgency, social proof, pain point, etc.)
```

### Exercise 2.1: Master Advanced Prompting

**Task:** Create advanced prompts for 3 different content types from your work.

**Challenge 1: Professional Email**
Write a prompt to generate a complex email (e.g., negotiation, difficult conversation, formal announcement).

**Your Prompt:**
```
[Write a detailed prompt using the CRAFT framework]
```

**Challenge 2: Long-Form Content**
Write a prompt to create a blog post, article, or report (500+ words).

**Your Prompt:**
```
[Include multi-step instructions and voice guidelines]
```

**Challenge 3: Creative Content**
Write a prompt for social media, marketing copy, or presentation content.

**Your Prompt:**
```
[Use constraint-based or role-play technique]
```

**Deliverable:** Test each prompt, note which techniques worked best, and refine based on results.

## Lesson 2.2: Maintaining Your Voice & Brand Consistency

### Why Voice Matters

When using AI for content creation, the biggest challenge is maintaining authenticity. Generic AI content is recognizable and unengaging. Your unique voice is your competitive advantage.

### Building a Voice Profile

Create a comprehensive voice profile to guide AI outputs.

**Voice Profile Template:**

```markdown
## My/Our Voice Profile

**Tone Characteristics:**
- [Adjective 1, e.g., Professional yet approachable]
- [Adjective 2, e.g., Confident but not arrogant]
- [Adjective 3, e.g., Informative with personality]

**Vocabulary Guidelines:**
- Words we USE often: [e.g., "proven", "practical", "actionable"]
- Words we AVOID: [e.g., "synergy", "revolutionary", "game-changer"]

**Sentence Structure:**
- Average sentence length: [e.g., 12-18 words]
- Paragraph length: [e.g., 2-4 sentences]
- Question usage: [e.g., rhetorical questions to engage]

**Content Patterns:**
- Opening style: [e.g., Start with a relatable scenario or surprising fact]
- Structure: [e.g., Use subheadings every 2-3 paragraphs]
- Closing style: [e.g., End with actionable takeaway]

**Perspective:**
- First person (I/we) vs. Third person: [Your preference]
- Active vs. Passive voice: [Prefer active voice]

**Humor & Emotion:**
- Use of humor: [e.g., Subtle humor, no sarcasm]
- Emotional appeals: [e.g., Empathy and understanding over fear]

**Examples:**
[Paste 2-3 samples of your best writing]
```

### Voice Calibration Prompt

Use this template to train AI on your voice:

```
I need you to write in my specific style. Here's my voice profile:

[Paste your voice profile from above]

Before writing any content for me:
1. Confirm you understand my voice characteristics
2. Ask clarifying questions if anything is unclear
3. Provide a brief sample (50 words) for me to approve

Once I approve, you can proceed with the full content.
```

### Brand Consistency Techniques

#### Technique 1: Brand Guideline Integration

**Prompt Example:**
```
Our brand guidelines for written content:

TONE: Professional, empowering, results-oriented
TARGET AUDIENCE: Small business owners, 30-50 years old, tech-savvy
KEY MESSAGES:
- AI makes you more productive, not replaceable
- Anyone can learn AI skills
- Practical application over theoretical knowledge

STYLE RULES:
- Use "you" language (speak directly to reader)
- One idea per paragraph
- Include specific examples and numbers
- No hyperbole or exaggeration

Write [content type] following these exact guidelines.
```

#### Technique 2: Content Audit & Alignment

Regularly check AI-generated content against your standards.

**Content Checklist:**
- ☐ Matches our tone profile
- ☐ Uses approved vocabulary
- ☐ Follows our structure patterns
- ☐ Sounds authentic, not robotic
- ☐ Aligns with brand values
- ☐ Includes specific examples/data
- ☐ Has clear call-to-action

#### Technique 3: Human Touch Points

Identify where to add personal elements AI can't replicate:

1. **Personal anecdotes**: Add your own stories
2. **Specific data**: Insert real numbers from your business
3. **Current events**: Reference timely, relevant topics
4. **Unique insights**: Add your professional expertise
5. **Authentic emotion**: Adjust language to reflect genuine feelings

### Exercise 2.2: Create Your Voice Profile

**Task:** Develop your personal or brand voice profile and test it with AI.

**Step 1: Gather Examples**
- Collect 3-5 pieces of your best writing
- These should represent your ideal voice

**Step 2: Analyze Patterns**
- What words do you use frequently?
- What's your average sentence length?
- How do you structure your content?
- What makes your writing unique?

**Step 3: Complete the Voice Profile Template**
Fill out the voice profile template provided above.

**Step 4: Test with AI**
- Use your voice profile in a prompt
- Generate a piece of content
- Compare it to your original writing
- Refine the profile based on results

**Deliverable:** A complete, tested voice profile document you can reuse for all future AI content generation.
