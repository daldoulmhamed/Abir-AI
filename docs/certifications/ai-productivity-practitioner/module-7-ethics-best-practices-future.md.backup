## Lesson 7.1: AI Ethics & Responsible Use

### Core Ethical Principles

#### 1. Transparency

**Principle:** Be clear about when and how you're using AI.

**In Practice:**
- Disclose AI assistance in professional contexts when appropriate
- Don't present AI-generated work as entirely your own
- Be transparent about capabilities and limitations
- Credit AI tools used (especially in academic or formal contexts)

**Examples:**

✅ **Appropriate:**
```
"This report was drafted with AI assistance and reviewed for accuracy."
"Content created with ChatGPT and edited by [Your Name]"
```

❌ **Inappropriate:**
```
Submitting AI-generated academic paper without disclosure
Taking full credit for AI-written code in team projects
Claiming AI analysis as your personal expertise
```

**Workplace Transparency:**
- Inform clients/stakeholders about AI use in deliverables
- Check company policies on AI tool usage
- Document AI-assisted processes
- Be clear about what parts required human expertise

#### 2. Accountability

**Principle:** You are responsible for AI outputs, even if AI generated them.

**Responsibilities:**
- **Verify accuracy**: AI can make mistakes—fact-check everything
- **Own the output**: You're accountable, not the AI
- **Review quality**: Ensure outputs meet professional standards
- **Fix errors**: When AI makes mistakes, it's your job to correct them

**Accountability Checklist:**

Before using AI output:
- ☐ Verified all facts and data
- ☐ Checked for bias or inappropriate content
- ☐ Ensured accuracy and appropriateness
- ☐ Reviewed for compliance (legal, ethical, company policies)
- ☐ Confirmed no plagiarism or copyright issues
- ☐ Tested functionality (for code or technical outputs)
- ☐ Added necessary disclosures

#### 3. Fairness & Bias Mitigation

**Principle:** Actively work to identify and reduce bias in AI usage.

**Understanding AI Bias:**

AI models learn from training data, which can contain biases:
- **Historical bias**: Patterns from biased historical data
- **Representation bias**: Underrepresentation of certain groups
- **Measurement bias**: Flawed data collection methods
- **Aggregation bias**: One-size-fits-all approach doesn't work for all groups

**Bias Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **Diverse Inputs**: Prompt AI to consider multiple perspectives
   ```
   Instead of: "Write marketing copy for our product"
   Try: "Write inclusive marketing copy that appeals to diverse audiences, 
   considering different ages, backgrounds, and abilities"
   ```

2. **Critical Review**: Examine outputs for stereotypes or exclusions
   - Does language assume certain demographics?
   - Are examples diverse and representative?
   - Could any phrasing be offensive to some groups?

3. **Test for Bias**: Use AI to check for bias
   ```
   "Review this content for potential bias regarding [gender/race/age/disability/etc.]. 
   Identify any problematic language or assumptions."
   ```

4. **Multiple Perspectives**: Generate multiple versions and compare
   ```
   "Generate 3 different versions of this content, 
   each considering different cultural contexts"
   ```

#### 4. Privacy & Confidentiality

**Principle:** Protect sensitive information in all AI interactions.

**Never Input into AI:**
- Personal identifiable information (PII)
- Confidential business data
- Trade secrets or proprietary information
- Client or customer private data
- Financial records
- Health information
- Passwords or access credentials
- Unpublished research or IP

**Safe AI Use Practices:**

✅ **Do:**
- Anonymize data before using AI (remove names, numbers, identifiers)
- Use placeholders: [Client], [Company Name], [Number]
- Check company AI usage policies
- Use enterprise AI tools with proper security for sensitive work
- Keep sensitive work on local/private AI deployments if available

❌ **Don't:**
- Paste confidential documents into public AI tools
- Share customer data without permission
- Use AI for HIPAA, GDPR, or other regulated data
- Input anything you wouldn't post publicly

**Example - Anonymization:**

❌ **Wrong:**
```
"Review this sales report for ABC Corp. John Smith bought $50,000 
of products, while Jane Doe only spent $5,000..."
```

✅ **Right:**
```
"Review this sales report structure. Client A purchased $50,000 worth of products, 
while Client B purchased $5,000. What insights can you provide?"
```

### Ethical Use Cases & Gray Areas

#### Scenario 1: Academic Integrity

**Situation:** Using AI for schoolwork

**Ethical Guidelines:**
- **Allowed (typically)**: Brainstorming, research assistance, learning concepts
- **Gray Area**: Editing and improving your writing (check institution policy)
- **Not Allowed**: Submitting AI work as yours, cheating on exams
- **Always**: Follow your institution's specific AI policies

**Best Practice:**
```
Think of AI as a tutor, not a substitute for learning.
Use AI to understand concepts, then demonstrate understanding yourself.
```

#### Scenario 2: Professional Work

**Situation:** Using AI for client deliverables

**Ethical Guidelines:**
- **Disclose**: Inform clients about AI usage if contractually required
- **Quality Assurance**: Review and validate all AI outputs
- **Add Value**: Use AI to enhance, not replace, your expertise

**Best Practice:**
```
AI should amplify your expertise, not replace it.
The final work should reflect your professional judgment.
```

#### Scenario 3: Creative Work

**Situation:** AI-generated art, writing, or content

**Ethical Guidelines:**
- **Attribution**: Credit AI tool used
- **Originality**: Significant human creative input
- **Copyright**: Understand that pure AI outputs may not be copyrightable
- **Fair Use**: Don't use AI to replicate copyrighted styles without permission

**Best Practice:**
```
Use AI as a collaborator, not a creator.
Add your unique perspective, style, and expertise.
```

### Exercise 7.1: Ethical Decision-Making

**Task:** Analyze ethical dilemmas and develop your ethical AI framework.

**Scenario 1: The Confidential Report**
Your manager asks you to quickly summarize a 50-page confidential strategy document. You have access to ChatGPT. What do you do?

**Questions to Consider:**
- What are the ethical concerns?
- What are your options?
- What would you actually do?
- How could you accomplish the task ethically?

**Scenario 2: The AI-Written Proposal**
You're rushing to finish a client proposal. AI generates a compelling version that's 90% usable with minimal edits. Do you:
- A) Use it as-is and submit?
- B) Heavily edit and add your insights?
- C) Use it as inspiration but rewrite entirely?
- D) Disclose AI use to the client?

**Analysis:**
- What factors influence your decision?
- What are the potential consequences of each choice?
- What's the right approach?

**Scenario 3: The Biased Output**
AI generates marketing content that, upon review, contains subtle gender stereotypes. What do you do?
- How do you identify bias?
- What's your responsibility?
- How do you fix it?
- How do you prevent it next time?

**Deliverable:**
- Written analysis of each scenario
- Your ethical framework for AI use
- Personal guidelines you'll follow
