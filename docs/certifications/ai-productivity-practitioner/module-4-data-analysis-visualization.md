## Tips & Common Mistakes

### 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start with Questions**: Define what you want to learn before analyzing
2. **Sample Before Full Analysis**: Test AI approaches on small data samples first
3. **Validate AI Formulas**: Always test formulas with known examples
4. **Keep It Simple**: Simplest visualization that conveys the message wins
5. **Document Your Process**: Save prompts and formulas that work well
6. **Check for Bias**: Be aware of sampling bias and data limitations
7. **Iterate on Visuals**: Create multiple versions and choose the clearest

### ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

1. **Garbage In, Garbage Out**: AI can't fix fundamentally flawed data
2. **Over-Complicated Visuals**: Too many elements confuse rather than clarify
3. **Correlation ≠ Causation**: AI might identify patterns that aren't meaningful
4. **Ignoring Context**: Numbers without business context are just numbers
5. **Analysis Paralysis**: Don't get stuck analyzing—move to decisions and action
6. **Formula Complexity**: Overly complex formulas are hard to maintain and debug
7. **Forgetting the Audience**: Technical analysis doesn't always translate well for executives
