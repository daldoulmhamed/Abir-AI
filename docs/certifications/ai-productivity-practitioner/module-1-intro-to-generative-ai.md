## 📖 Lesson 1.1: Understanding Generative AI Basics

### What is Generative AI?

Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems capable of creating new content—text, images, code, audio, or video—based on patterns learned from existing data. Unlike traditional software that follows explicit instructions, generative AI models learn from examples and generate original outputs.

### 🔑 Key Concepts

**1. Large Language Models (LLMs)**

LLMs are AI systems trained on massive volumes of text data to understand and generate human-like text.

Major examples include:
- **ChatGPT (GPT-4)**: developed by OpenAI
- **Claude**: created by Anthropic
- **Gemini**: designed by Google
- **LLaMA**: developed by Meta

**2. Training and Learning**

AI models learn patterns from billions of examples, enabling them to:
- Understand context and nuances
- Generate coherent and relevant responses
- Adapt to different tasks and domains

**3. Tokens**

Tokens are the units of text that AI models process (approximately 3-4 characters per token). This concept is important for:
- Understanding input/output limits
- Managing context windows (for example: 8K, 32K, 128K tokens)

### 📊 Differences: Traditional Software vs. Generative AI

**Traditional Software:**
- Follows explicit rules
- Produces deterministic results
- Limited to programmed functions
- Requires code for updates

**Generative AI:**
- Learns from patterns
- Generates probabilistic results
- Flexible across many tasks
- Improves with new training data

### 🌍 Real-World Applications

**Content Creation**

Generative AI excels at creating various types of written content:
- Writing emails, reports, and professional documents
- Creating marketing copy and social media posts
- Generating blog articles and document summaries

**Problem Solving**

Use AI to enhance your thinking and solve complex challenges:
- Brainstorming innovative ideas and solutions
- Analyzing data and extracting relevant insights
- Debugging code and solving technical problems

**Learning & Research**

AI becomes your personal learning assistant:
- Explaining complex concepts in simple terms
- Summarizing long documents into key points
- Answering questions across all domains

**Productivity**

Automate and optimize your daily tasks:
- Automating repetitive tasks
- Organizing and structuring information
- Creating reusable templates and frameworks

### ✍️ Exercise 1.1: Identify AI Use Cases

**Objective:** Think concretely about applying AI in your context

**Instructions:**
List 5 tasks from your daily work or studies that could benefit from AI assistance.

**Concrete example:**
1. Writing professional emails in French and English
2. Summarizing meeting minutes
3. Creating structures for PowerPoint presentations
4. Translating and adapting technical documents
5. Generating creative ideas for projects

**Your turn!**

Write your own list by thinking about:
- Which tasks take the most time?
- Which tasks are repetitive and time-consuming?
- Which tasks require creativity?

💡 **Tip:** Keep this list handy — you'll use it throughout the certification to build practical, personalized AI workflows.

## 📖 Lesson 1.3: Prompting Fundamentals

### What is Prompting?

A **prompt** is the instruction or input you give to an AI model. Effective prompting is like clear communication — the better you explain what you need, the better the results will be.

### 🎨 Anatomy of a Good Prompt

**4 Key Elements**

**1. Role/Context** — Who should the AI be?
- Examples: "You are a professional email writer..."
- "Act as a Python programming tutor..."

**2. Task** — What should the AI do?
- "Write a...", "Summarize...", "Explain...", "Create..."

**3. Specifics** — Important details and requirements
- Format, length, tone, audience, constraints

**4. Output Format** — How should the response be structured?
- "Provide 3 key points", "Format as a table", "Use JSON format"

### 📝 Basic Prompting Templates

**Template 1: Direct Request**

**Structure:** Simple, clear instruction

**Practical example:**
→ "Summarize this article in 3 key points: [article text]"

**Template 2: Role-Based Prompt**

**Structure:** Define a role + task

**Practical example:**
→ "You are a marketing expert. Create 5 catchy headlines for a blog article about remote work productivity."

**Template 3: Constrained Output**

**Structure:** Task + specific constraints

**Practical example:**
→ "Write a professional email to decline a meeting invitation. Limit yourself to 100 words and keep a friendly tone."

**Template 4: Step-by-Step**

**Structure:** Ask AI to break down its process

**Practical example:**
→ "Explain how to change a car tire. Provide step-by-step instructions with safety warnings."

### ❌ Common Prompting Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Too Vague**

❌ Bad example:
→ "Tell me about marketing."

✅ Better example:
→ "Explain the 3 most effective digital marketing strategies for small businesses in 2024, with concrete examples."

**Mistake 2: Too Many Tasks at Once**

❌ Bad example:
→ "Write a blog article, create social media captions, design a content calendar, and suggest hashtags for my tech startup."

✅ Better example:
→ "Write a 500-word blog article about AI productivity tools for small business owners. Target audience: non-technical entrepreneurs. Include 3 specific tool recommendations."

**Mistake 3: Assuming AI Knows Your Context**

❌ Bad example:
→ "Improve this. [paste text]"

✅ Better example:
→ "Improve this customer service email to be more professional and empathetic. Context is a response to a complaint about late delivery: [email text]"

**Mistake 4: Not Specifying Format**

❌ Bad example:
→ "Give me information about Python data types."

✅ Better example:
→ "Create a comparison table of Python data types (string, int, float, list, dict, tuple). Include: type name, description, common use case, syntax example."

### 🌟 Best Practices for Beginners

**1. Start Simple, Then Iterate**
- Begin with a basic prompt
- Examine the result
- Refine your prompt based on what's missing

**2. Be Specific About Constraints**
- Length (words, paragraphs, pages)
- Tone (professional, casual, friendly)
- Audience (experts, beginners, children)
- Format (bullet points, paragraphs, code, table)

**3. Provide Examples When Possible**
- Show the AI what you want
- "Write in a style similar to this example: [example]"

**4. Request Multiple Options**
- "Give me 5 different approaches..."
- "Provide 3 variations..."
- Increases chances of getting what you need

**5. Use Follow-Up Questions**
- AI remembers conversation context
- "Make it shorter", "Add more details about X", "Rewrite in a more casual tone"

### ✍️ Exercise 1.3: Practice Basic Prompting

**Objective:** Write and test prompts for different scenarios

**Scenario 1: Email Writing**

Write a prompt to generate a professional email thanking a colleague for their help on a project.

**Your Prompt:**
[Write your prompt here applying the 4 key elements]

**Scenario 2: Learning a Concept**

Write a prompt to learn a technical subject in your field (e.g., "blockchain", "agile methodology", "SEO basics").

**Your Prompt:**
[Write your prompt here]

**Scenario 3: Content Creation**

Write a prompt to create a presentation outline on a subject you know well.

**Your Prompt:**
[Write your prompt here]

**Deliverable:**
- Test each prompt with an AI
- If the response isn't perfect, revise your prompt
- Note what you changed and why
- Save your best prompts for future use

## 💡 Tips & Common Pitfalls

### Pro Tips

**1. Keep a Prompt Library**
Save prompts that work well for reuse and modification

**2. Experiment with Different AIs**
The same prompt can give different results depending on the tool

**3. Use Conversation History**
Build on previous responses rather than starting from scratch

**4. Be Polite**
While not necessary, many users find that polite prompts give better results

**5. Verify Information**
AI can make mistakes — always verify important information

### ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

**1. Treating AI Like a Search Engine**
AI generates responses, it doesn't just retrieve facts

**2. Not Iterating on Prompts**
The first response is rarely perfect — refine and improve

**3. Ignoring AI Limitations**
AI cannot (in most cases) access real-time data or personal files

**4. Over-Dependence on AI**
Use AI to enhance, not replace, your critical thinking

**5. Forgetting Privacy**
Don't share sensitive or confidential information in AI chats
